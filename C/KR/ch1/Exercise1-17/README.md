**Exercise 1-17** Write a program to print all input lines that are longer than 80 characters.

**筆記:**\
這個練習題與上一個非常相似，只不過這次不需要將最長的字串儲存起來，取而代之的是把所有長度大於80的字串
列印出來。

**Brief explination:**\
This exercise is very similar to the previous one. However, there is no need to remember the longest 
string this time. Instead, we print out all strings which are longer than 80 characters.
